he that is yours, sweet lady.
whose solid virtue could be neither grazed nor pierced by the shot of accident or dart of fate?
there’d be no work .
if you take more or less than exactly a pound ,  even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even so much as a hair ,  you die ,  and all your property will be confiscated .
let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
who has a breast so pure that some unclean thoughts keep court records and legal holidays ,  and sit in session with lawful deliberations ?
i’ll follow you and turn this hell i’m in into a kind of heaven .
the ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to .
you don’t have reasonto say so .
poor bankrupt, break at once!
not i ,  my lord .
o shame!
tell what you are.
ah ,  that same pale hard - hearted wench ,  that rosaline ,  torments him so that he will sure run mad .
if it’s good ,  why do i give in to that suggestion whose horrid image makes my hair stand on end ,  and makes my heart pound so hard they knock at my ribs ,  against my will to stay calm ?
yes ,  shylock ,  i’ll put my seal to this promise to pay .
come ,  sit down ,  every mother's son ,  and rehearse your parts .
cassio !
will you be ready?
you have taken it more seriously than i meant you to .
don’t come near till you hear me call you .
i heard a voice cry, "sleep no more!
a happiness that often craziness hits on ,  which reason and sanity couldn’t arranged so happily .
lord ,  so what ?
here ,  at your service .
no ,  he’s a devil—a devil ,  i tell you !
i’ll wait for her here and when she comes i’ll take a novel approach with her .
the grave where she’s buried ,  that is also her womb ,  and ,  from her womb ,  we find children of diverse kinds when we are sucking on her natural bosom; many plants are excellent for many virtues ,  some have none ,  others have some ,  but are all different .
my poor heart is so aggravated for a kinsman ,  madam ,  that if you could only find a man to bear a poison ,  i would help to mix it ,  so that romeo should ,  when he gets it ,  soon sleep in quiet .
you told a lie; an stinking ,  damned lie; on my soul ,  a lie; a wicked lie .
all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand .
we must not give in to hugs and kisses until midnight tomorrow.
what, are you crazy?
o god ,  she comes !
my lord, you loved me once.
save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
name them .
what's the matter ?
yes ,  i do .
oh, good sir, i am!
and how he loves caesar !
i’m at your service until death .
and like i am for ganymede .
what ,  was i married to her in a dream ?
therefore ,  dear isis ,  do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
here i am.
this fellow's exceedingly honesty, and knows all qualities, with an educated spirit, of human dealings.
have you told her our decision ?
but you’re not down and out ,  either ,  are you ?
did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?
how horrible !
i’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s .
edward plantagenet ,  why are you dead ?
you are a rude ,  ragged nurse and an old ,  sullen playmate for such tender princes .
caesar, all hail!
from now on, i’ll never be “romeo.” what man are you who, wrapped in the cover of night, stumbles on my private thoughts?
you thief of love!
the king rode out alone to view their troops .
before sunrise tomorrow ,  we’ll kill anyone who escaped today .
then it’s certain they’re heading for cyprus .
come on; in this transaction ,  there can be no fear; my ships come home a month before the due date .
this business is well ended .
then whistle to me as signal that you hear something approaching .
why would titania want to argue with her oberon ?
now i am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person .
we must not give in to hugs and kisses until midnight tomorrow .
now talk to him in your own voice ,  and tell me how he is .
every day you get me out of the way with some plan, iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keep from me all convenience than supplies me with the least advantage of hope.
i’m glad to see you .
what an idiot this guy is ! —you’re a rotten piece of work ! —i beg your highness ,  beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .
what, do you present your petitions in the street?
i’ll ask later; first let’s go in to dinner.
get out ,  dog !
please— chiefly that i might say it in my prayers— what is your name ?
not really ,  for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
here comes my lady .
i’m everywhere .
true .
honestly ,  it’s not as good as the other one ,  and i’m sure your cousin will agree with me .
sweet friends, i’m sorry i’m late; not i, but my affairs, have made you wait: when you are ready to do anything to get wives, i'll watch as long for you then.
should i tell you why ?
come on ,  i’ll fight you .
why ,  what have you done ,  sweet beatrice ?
no ,  good goose ,  don’t bite .
are you talking ,  you villain ?
that’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues ,  like i do .
oh ,  wait ,  sir .
it shall be said that his judgment ruled our hands; our youths and wildness won’t appear at all ,  but all be buried in his seriousness .
he was in bed with— with her ?
brother ,  hey !
didn’t you know ?
but ,  alas ,  caesar must bleed for it !
here ,  peter quince .
well.
nature would produce its harvests in abundance ,  to feed my innocent people .
get them in here .
unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract ,  you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud .
this way you show me friendship .
in my youth i truly suffered much agony for love almost like this .
yes ,  sir ,  that soaks up the king's face ,  his rewards ,  his authorities .
wake up and see yourself .
believe me ,  love ,  it was the nightingale .
a soldier, and afeard?
stay then; i'll go alone.
malvolio’s coming down the path .
i understand now .
yes ,  we are .
oh ,  hello ,  father !
no ,  my lord ,  not me .
who calls me villain?
i am your spaniel ,  and ,  demetrius ,  the more you beat me ,  the more i will wag my tail for you .
come ,  friends .
i’m ready and waiting . —give me your hand ,  bassanio .
nearest his heart .  ” —those are the very words .
on monday morning, it was true indeed.
goodbye .
is it feasible ?
brother ,  you’ve made a mistake .
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove a donkey.
is it your own desire to come here ?
if he isn’t what he might be ,  then i wish to god he were !
goodbye .
no one but a holy hermit and her maid .
welcome, good marcellus.
night hangs on my eyes; my bones that have only labored to attain this hour want to rest.
if we crown him ,  i have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage .
put your straw hats on ,  have some fun ,  and dance with these young nymphs .
she will really curse me that romeo has had no news of these events; but i will write to him again in mantua, and keep her at my cell until romeo comes to get her; poor living corpse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
he’s great - looking ,  but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language ?
he did this in public ?
give me the daggers .
it’s a miracle you’re alive .
in genoa ?
and ,  after that he came ,  away sad ?
you do, and you think it’s a lot to walk the waves of the ocean, to run on the sharp wind of the north, to do my business under the earth when it is baked with frost.
you all saw that, on the feast of the priest lupercus, i presented a kingly crown to him three times, which he refused three times.
he left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the porcupine ,  where i was dining with balthasar .
if it’s good, why do i give in to that suggestion whose horrid image makes my hair stand on end, and makes my heart pound so hard they knock at my ribs, against my will to stay calm?
stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him ,  and i laughed and refused to flee with him .
sir ,  it’s the fifteenth day of march .
why, it stood by her.
they shouted three times .
farewell .
mixed it with dust ,  to which it is related .
let me ,  on my knee ,  win this argument .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice that much ?
then stay with us .
that’s why the king of france listened to my pleas and tears .
his body will lie in my tent tonight ,  with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
what’s her name ?
is this true ?
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a tomb .
o for shame!
sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar ,  right ?
i still fear him, because in the acquired love he bears to caesar— alas, good cassius, don’t think of him.
not for cadwallader and all his goats .
so ,  please ,  my lord ,  don’t assume that i’m treacherous just because i’m poor ,  with no titles to my name .
she is in a better place .
it is locked in my memory, and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
o heaven !
invoke his warlike spirit and that of edward the black prince ,  your great - uncle ,  who fought a tragic battle on french soil ,  routing the french army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop ,  smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of french noblemen .
i’m sorry they offend you ,  heartily ,  yes ,  indeed ,  heartily .
bleed ,  bleed ,  poor country !
it was a rough night .
oh ,  my lord ,  what do you mean by that ?
i can explain it, at least, what’s on the grapevine.
there they go ,  silver !
richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
he ,  being weak ,  most generous ,  and free from all trickery ,  will not think about swords ,  so that easily ,  or with a little mix up ,  you may choose a sword that’s not poisoned ,  and ,  in a pass during practice ,  kill him in revenge for your father .
i'll do it, but it doesn’t like me.
pindarus, ask our commanders to lead their men a little away from this place.
young budding virgin ,  fair and pure and sweet ,  where are you off to ?
that’s true .
who ,  me ?
until i know for sure ,  i’ll humor her .
as if that name of romeo, shot from the deadly level of a gun, murdered her the same way as that name's cursed hand murdered her kinsman.
will you come ?
you certainly bar the door to your own freedom if you don’t tell your problems to your friend.
yes ,  casca ,  tell us what has happened today that makes caesar look so sad .
we have to be married properly .
no ,  please .
but those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service ,  especially if i’m gone and someone else has my job .
now you and i have a new friendship ,  and will solemnly dance in duke theseus' house triumphantly ,  tomorrow at midnight and bless it for all fair prosperity .
they say there's only five on this island; we’re three of them; if the other two are brained like us ,  the state shakes .
love cools off ,  friendships break up ,  and brothers become enemies .
tell me ,  how did you get in here ?
i will, my lord.
tell me seriously ,  who is the one you love ?
go, villain, get a doctor.
set up the goblets of wine for me on that table.
absolutely ,  yes indeed .
in such a night pretty jessica, like a little witch, lied about her love, and he forgave her.
was there ever a book containing such vile matter so beautifully bound?
hide ,  i hear him coming .
your friends.
this might be my lord so-and-so, that praised my lord such-and-such's horse when he meant to ask for it, might it not?
i could go around the world in forty minutes .
it is a speck of dust to irritate the mind's eye.
didn’t he say my brother has run away ?
thanks, courteous wall.
o, but i fear how lost you each other?
he said  “ goodbye ,  madam ,  ”  and nothing else .
even though everything evil wants to look good ,  good still has to look good too .
as good a reason as any .
dear gods in heaven ,  what’s the reason for this ?
that makes us kinder, to give them thanks for nothing.
come ,  swear it ,  damn yourself; lest ,  being like one of heaven ,  the devils themselves should fear to seize you .
the man who gives away his crust and his crumbs will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
get going ,  i say; you shall know more later; no ,  get going .
do not ask to know any more .
unkindness may do much, and his unkindness may kill my life, but never taint my love.
imagination!
to have no separation between this part he played and the man he played it for, he had to become the absolute duke of milan.
no ,  sir .
put out your torches .
i will go out .
my breath ,  cooling my soup ,  would make me ill ,  when i thought about the damage a mighty wind might do at sea .
hello !
so ,  the man would talk half as much as benedick and be half as serious as don john— and if he were handsome ,  agile ,  and rich ,  too ,  he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will .
let’s proceed to the field .
we’re not saying anything treasonous ,  man .
hail ,  king !
then please ,  put off your eating for a little while i ,  like a mother doe ,  find my fawn and bring it food .
i’m not going to waste any more time with you .
the only thing that i’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house ,  the phoenix ,  for lunch .
a messenger from the galleys .
poor man !
it’s something ,  it’s nothing: it’s yours ,  it’s mine ,  and it’ll belong to thousands more .
you say only  “ i ,  ”  and i shall poison that bare vowel more than the death - darting eye of the serpent hatched from an egg .
tell me again ,  where did you leave these varlets ?
when powerful kings cave in to flatterers ,  do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ?
we have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea ,  breasting the high waves .
and ,  moreover ,  god saw benedick when he was hid in the garden .
come on ,  you’re being too hard on yourself .
is it more sin to wish me to be a liar ,  or to curse my husband with the same tongue that she has praised him with ,  above compare so many thousand times ?
brother ,  i’m giving you good advice .
i couldn’t go to mantua because i was stuck there .
no .
will you abandon such gentle lambs ,  god ,  and throw them to the wolves ?
should you do so, my lord, my speech should fall into such vile things that my thoughts are not aimed at.
some go to decius' house, and some to casca's, some to ligarius'.
there they launched us ,  to cry to the sea that roared at us ,  to sigh to the winds ,  whose pity ,  sighing back again ,  only did us loving wrong .
what!
i can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard  “ husband ,  ”  and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant .
i might do something i’ll be sorry for .
amazingly sleepy!
so i say, he has put up with all things well, and i think that, if he had duncan's sons in his prison, as, if it please heaven, he shall not, they should find what it meant to kill a father.
does anyone know if donalbain is with his brother ?
now as for the other thing ,  you do remember all the circumstances ?
we wish your peace.
no ,  this was only his dream .
no, he has simply the best wit of any working man in athens.
stay there and fortify it well against the french .
love's heralds should be thoughts, which glide ten times faster than the sun's beams, driving back shadows over lowering hills.
she’s probably right .
fly ,  for that reason ,  noble cassius ,  fly far off .
this is a foolish man without merit ,  good to be sent on errands .
let me choose now .
look !
do you hear that ,  charmian ?
now he is for the numbers that petrarch flowed in !
what’s the name of the play ?
just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven ,  indulge me ,  forgive me ,  and set me free .
demetrius doesn’t think so; he won’t know what everyone but him knows.
is it out of lust ?
i will die and leave him my entire estate.
if it takes all the wine in my bottle ,  i’ll cure him .
if we meet again ,  then we’ll smile .
it is a good prophet that follows his own instructions; it’s easier for me to teach twenty people what was good to do than to be one of that twenty and follow my own teaching.
listen ,  fairy king .
that ,  sir ,  which i will not report about her .
do you want to hear what she says ?
what are we going to give as our excuse?
let’s go to the temple first .
then don’t move while i take my prayer's answer.
shylock is my name .
for my part ,  i have walked about the streets ,  giving in to the dangerous night; and ,  undressed like this ,  casca ,  as you can see ,  i have bared my chest to the thunder bolts; and when the angry ,  blue lightning seemed to openthe chest of heaven ,  i put myself even in the direction and the very flash of it .
i am hers: only ,  oh !
well ,  well; but ,  as for me ,  as i have made up my mind to run away ,  so i’ll not rest until i have run some ground .
just obey me a little bit longer .
he builds our fires ,  gets our firewood ,  and does all kinds of useful things for us . —hey !
why do you complain about your birth, the heaven, and earth?
if that’s the case ,  tears wash my eyes more than hers .
if i know this, and know the whole world too, i can shake off at pleasure that part of tyranny that i endure.
what upsets you ,  your highness ?
that’s what her mother always tells me .
yes ,  your majesty .
but ,  sir ,  take my advice .
rome ,  there are no more people of noble bloods in you !
it scares me just to hear you talk about it .
lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.
there are two in the same room.
kinsmen ,  i hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
and at the base of pompey’s statue ,  with his cloak covering his face ,  which was dripping with blood the whole time ,  great caesar fell .
on one and the same trip claribel found a husband in tunis ,  and ferdinand ,  her brother ,  found a wife where he was shipwrecked; prospero found his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves .
let’s act quickly .
i have to get to the barber's ,  sir ,  because i think i have an awful lot of hair on my face ,  and i am such a sensitive donkey ,  that i must scratch even if my hair only tickles me a little .
yes ,  i do ,  lady .
besides ,  he’s young and handsome ,  and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for .
ay, that left pap, where the heart beats.— thus die i, thus, thus, thus.
i’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
but first, i will release the fairy queen.
and there’s nothing i can do about it .
you cram these words into my ears against the stomach of my sense.
it starts ,   “ shut up .  ”  i’ll never be able to start if i shut up .
why, she’s inside.
do you confess so much ?
i can hear the lark singing .
that baron of cawdor shall no longer betray matters close to our heart .
if you make us musicians, look to hear nothing but noise.
their lips ,  like four red roses on a stalk ,  touched .
now my friend petruchio will help me out ,  presenting me to old baptista as a schoolmaster for bianca well - versed in music .
i want all such offenders to be dealt with that way ,  and i give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages ,  nothing taken that is not paid for ,  none of the french harassed or abused in disrespectful language .
no ?
did you see the weird sisters ?
have a nice day !
if there were anything inside their heads ,  they could never wear such heavy helmets .
never .
now what ?
o desdemon !
i hear his trumpet .
i can only think that desdemona's honest .
no ,  the clock has already struck twelve .
now when you awake ,  see with yours own fool's eyes .
by divine providence .
he looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
go !
do you love me ?
he is indeed worthy of the name  “ horse ,  ”  and you can call all the rest beasts .
he may win; and what is music then ?
when the moon was shining, we did not see the candle.
i put those wedding sheets on your bed ,  as you asked .
i’ll do the best i can ,  my lord .
i humbly beg you, proceed to the affairs of state.
go find him there.
my lord?
or maybe ,  to make it even more lovely ,  i’ll sing it when the heroine dies .
i hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon .
the day ,  my friends ,  and everything await me .
in my desperate situation ,  i have to act alone .
your threats don’t scare me ,  cassius ,  because i’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze .
your mother’s name has become a threat to her own children .
prince, as you are true, for blood of ours shed blood of montague.
ah ,  there’s the problem .
it will not be seen in him there .
and ,  noble signior ,  if virtue is missing delightful beauty ,  your son - in - law is far more just than black .
these tidings would comfort cassius very well.
give me some trinket of yours ,  and i will wear it in my hat .
then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
like this ,  sir: although this lord of weak memory ,  this man who shall be remembered little when he is buried ,  here has almost persuaded , — because he's a spirit of persuasion ,  only he professes to persuade , —the king’s son is alive ,  it is as impossible that he's not drowned as he who sleeps here swims .
he’s subhuman ,  like an animal .
yes ,  with the sign underneath him that says:  “ here lives benedick the married man ”  ?
i have looked on the world for twenty eight years, and since i could distinguish between a benefit and a disadvantage, i’ve never found man that knew how to love himself.
keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants ,  obeying my commands .
please go away ,  both of you .
but oops ,  when i let go of your hand ,  i let go of the biggest joke of all .
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight, to disturb my funeral prayers and the rites of true love?
wisely, and slowly.
why ,  uncle ,  it’s a shame .
because my name is george .
no one marries the second without killing the first love.
see ,  see ,  our honored hostess !
i had rather be a toad ,  and live on the air of a dungeon ,  than keep a piece of the thing i love for others' uses .
i predict he comes to tell me of the players ,  listen .
i cannot find it; it’s not in the promise to pay .
some tardy cripple must have taken the counter - order ,  who came after clarence was already buried .
good - bye ,  sir .
you shall have nothing but the penalty to be so taken at your own risk, jew.
now you’re romeo .
good romeo, hide yourself.
besides that ,  he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow ,  and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him ,  who are at the other ,  sorry .
at the bottom ,  any change is for the better .
amen, amen!
i’m sure of that .
of brave earls ,  grandpré and roussi ,  fauconberg and foix ,  beaumont and marle ,  vaudemont and lestrale .
i’m begging you ,  tell me who it is quickly ,  and speak fast .
it is good that you found me.
amen .
you’re in trouble either way .
mother ,  you have offended my father very much .
come on .
now ,  your gown ?
listen ,  listen ,  someone is knocking .
if you want to cry over my bad luck ,  i’ll give you my eyes .
you won’t be wasting your time ,  because i really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music ,  so he’ll be happy to have me in his service .
i’ll go hunting again tomorrow ,  i think .
let’s join them ,  since our predicament is the same as theirs .
i can’t do that: i accept his ring most thankfully; and please tell him so; furthermore ,  please show my youth to old shylock's house .
of course ,  sir .
yes, so i thought.
he tried to kill me recently ,  very recently .
and i .
if they’ll do neither ,  we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings .
o ,  now ,  forever farewell to the peaceful mind !
where is she ?
i am amazed, and don’t know what to say.
what, have you lost your wits?
good - bye ,  son .
what ,  gertrude ?
while i use you to solve this affair, i'll go to my queen, and beg the indian boy from her; and then i will release her charmed eye so that she will see the monster, and all things shall be at peace.
you may as well undertake to be hanged .
what should i do that i’m not doing ?
mis-shapen disorder of perfectly pleasing forms!
tyrrel ,  come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
i think that, since she must die once, i have the patience to endure it now.
so ,  like a painted tyrant ,  pyrrhus stood ,  and ,  as if not giving in to his will and body ,  did nothing .
but ,  tell me ,  where is the noble richmond now ?
murder !
until then, goodbye, and keep this holy kiss.
you know where i live .
with my eye sockets ?
i’ll take no lesser name than that of  something that refers to my current state .
we don’t intend to harm you, or any other roman.
give me that chisel-edged pick and the iron wrench.
he hasn’t done anything to harm you yet .
go, leave me.
run away ,  i beg you !
o ,  kinsman too nice ,  and yet too true !
on a night like this ,  pretty jessica ,  in a bad mood ,  said outrageously wrong things about her lover ,  and he forgave her .
my dear madam ,  why are you in mourning ?
go ahead ,  but i won’t listen .
what am i ,  a cane ?
i don’t want to dance .
go back to bed .
i am glad of it.
my lord ?
i hope ,  in no place so unsanctified or shamed as where such as you may find him .
well ,  is it not news that petruchio’s coming ?
buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
this last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting .
i wish you had my bones, and i had your news.
farewell.
where nothing ,  but who knows nothing ,  is once seen to smile ,  where sighs ,  and groans ,  and shrieks ,  that tear at the air ,  are made ,  not marked ,  where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy .
a hit, a hit that was felt.
ha ,  ha ,  heard in genoa .
come ,  come ,  hurry up .
rebellious hell, if you can rebel in an old lady’s bones, then let virtue be like wax to burning youth, and melt in her own fire.
sir paris ,  i’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love .
we shall know by this fellow .
you are to blame,—i must be plain with you,— to part so quickly with your wife's first gift, a thing stuck on your finger with oaths, and so nailed with faith to your flesh with faith.
o cassius, you’re connected to a lamb that carries anger as a match makes fire, who, very irritated, shows a hasty spark, and right away is cold again.
so pardon him ,  dear father ,  for my sake .
oh ,  most bloody sight !
and look where publius is coming to go get me.
my lord ,  i know what i’m saying .
that don john had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the lady hero .
excellent .
indeed !
i’ll call you  “ hamlet senior ,  ”   “ king ,  ”   “ father ,  ”   “ royal dane .  ”  answer me !
fetch me this herb and come right back before a huge sea creature can swim three miles.
why, what, kinsman!
go to; farewell.
there were enough christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .
you can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie .
grab down chairs ,  windows ,  anything .
a solemn song, and the best comforter to an unsettled mind, cure for your brains, now useless, boiled inside your skull!
statilius waved the torchlight at us ,  but he hasn’t come back .
he’s married to octavia ,  madam .
trebonius wants you to read this humble suit at your leisure.
good heart ,  at what ?
remember you !
all your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did ,  though to me it’s far from your best attribute .
even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself .
we thought you ought to know about it .
do you believe his  “ offers ,  ”  as you call them ?
oh, hell!
don’t weep ,  don’t weep .
trinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand, i will displace some of your teeth.
he’s close by, and pindarus has come to bring you greetings from his master.
leave me quickly .
but she loves it so much (since othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
i’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose ,  just to see how brave they are .
there the grown serpent lies; the worm that has fled has a nature that in time will breed venom ,  but he has no fangs now .
it was about to speak, when the rooster crowed.
or like a whale .
there is no world without verona walls, only purgatory, torture, hell itself.
by mary, that, i think, is young petruchio.
a villain kills my father ,  and for that ,  i ,  his sole son ,  do this same villain send to heaven .
you can have anything you want .
let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears .
what common uses we may return to ,  horatio !
there is no life ,  but my love is dead !
she cursed hastings then .
who is to be buried in it ?
not me ,  believe me .
oh ,  stephano ,  two men from naples survived !
isn’t it strange ,  canidius ,  that he could cross the ionian sea so quickly from tarentum and brundusium and take toryne ? —have you heard about this ,  sweet ?
cassio!
it’s a wild night .
o sin sweetly encouraged !
i don’t doubt your wisdom.
give me your hand .
he's for a jig or a dirty tale ,  or he sleeps .
my plans are almost at their climax .
lady ,  such a man as all the world why he's the very image of a wax statue .
well ,  enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
that’s too long a pause over what you find there .
you lie .
i order you, go home.
so far i’ve done exactly what i was supposed to do—i put the love potion on an athenian’s eyes .
will you cover ,  then ,  sir ?
god bless you ,  my friend ,  and your music too .
o gods ,  you gods !
holy saint francis ,  this is a drastic change !
for your three thousand dollars, here are six.
now ,  good metellus ,  go ask him .
but let’s shake hands ,  menas .
besides ,  it seems that ,  even if he had the money right now to pay the jew ,  he wouldn’t take it .
the noble brutus is on the platform .
yes ,  and brought off the field .
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clothes.
but your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
set fire !
so were their daggers ,  which we found on their pillows ,  unwiped .
you’re a villain to say this about me .
yes ,  exactly .
you’re wrong about that ,  i assure you .
this morning ,  they have fled away and are gone; and in their places ,  ravens ,  crows ,  and kites fly over our heads and look down on us as if we were sickly prey .
yes ,  it’s true ,  sir .
well said, old mole!
there ! … and over there ! … and over there !
no, you must forget that.
go find him ,  please ,  and bring him to my tent .
and yet it is almost against my conscience .
how did you come here ?
lord hamlet . — please let him be all right !
who’s coming here ?
what, brutus?
how is my lady doing?
i told him what i thought; and told no more than what he himself discovered was right and true.
good - bye ,  good - bye ,  good - bye .
what do you say ,  your highness ,  about my just request ?
please go inside .
i’ll sue him for assault and battery ,  if there’s any justice in illyria .
if i were to make a prediction regarding this union ,  i wouldn’t say that .
oh stephano ,  do you have any more of that wine ?
i’ll frown at them as they pass by ,  and they can react however they want .
have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
not true ,  not true .
we’ll win yet .
the owl made noise all night .
will you agree with me that ferdinand is drowned?
i don’t really want to do this ,  but he’s given me good reasons .
not so, sir, neither; i know my duty.
she deceived her father by marrying you; and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks ,  she loved them most .
caesar speaks.
oh ,  he’s like a snake disguised as a flower .
turns out to be untrue; their battles are nearby .
he went before me ,  and still dares me to fight; when i get to where he’s calling from ,  he’s gone .
i curse him ,  but he loves me .
you were the doctor ,  and i didn’t know you ?
i wouldn’t have them see you here for the world .
don’t let my prayers go unanswered ,  hamlet .
i find you ready, and if you were duller than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on the river bank, you wouldn’t move on this.
with all my heart .
the worse that you give me the additional information whose lack of information even kills me.
will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play ?
portia ,  what are you doing awake ?
this is most brave, that i, the son of a dear father murdered, prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, must, like a whore, release the content of my heart with words, and fall down cursing like a very drab, menial servant in the kitchen!
emperor caesar, dead and turned to clay, might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
the charm dissolves quickly; and as the morning steals on into the night, melting the darkness, so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that cloud their clearer reason.—o good gonzalo!
i bleed ,  sir ,  but i am not killed .
come on ,  relax ,  dear .
o misery!
because we are servants, and you think we are ruffians, you'd have your daughter covered with a african horse; you'd have your nephews neigh to you; you'd have chargers for cousins and small spanish horses for germans.
the best ?
be careful ,  fair maid .
for pity’s sake ,  my lord ,  my wife died tonight .
and i hope you won’t think badly of me .
all hail, macbeth!
and you ,   and how are you liking the shepherd’s life ,  master touchstone ?
rosalind ,  i have to leave you for two hours .
i’ll agree to those terms and even say that jews are nice .
good night ,  lord brutus .
but maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
that part of his reputation will stand .
cassius ,  go to the next street and divide the crowd .
good day . —please tell me ,  sir ,  can you read ?
go before ,  nurse .
your royal father was a most sainted king, the queen that bore you, oftener upon her knees than on her feet, died every day she lived.
do so; and after two days ,  i will set you free .
it beckons you to go away with it ,  as if it had something to say to you alone .
to breastfeed fools and make a record of a little beer.
you thought so, and took his side when we decided who should die, in our black punishment and condemning to death.
wash your hands ,  put on your nightgown; look not so pale .
i’m afraid i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar; i really do fear it.
go .
why do you need twenty - five knights ,  or ten ,  or even five ,  when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ?
besides ,  how have i offended you ,  my friends ?
let me find him ,  fortune !
the victim that smiles steals something from the thief; he robs himself that spends a unprofitable grief.
for lawyers on vacation ,  because they sleep their holidays away ,  with no sense of how time moves .
go wisely and slowly .
what else is love ?
he eats tonight with a harlot, and i will go there to him.
he feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while i sit at home starving for a smile from him .
my baby hawk ?
it is a monster fathered by itself, born of itself.
no ,  my lord .
his soldiers were destroyed while we are all surrounded by antony.
will they stop pursuing the stage when they can no longer sing?
brutus ,  may i have a word with you ?
i don’t like your faults .
so is lysander.
i’m whipped and tortured— may god give you a good evening .
so is lysander .
so i guess it’s you ,  you silver treasure house .
i know that he’ll be on our side .
what, hey!
and the right valiant banquo was out too late ,  whom ,  you may say ,  if it please you ,  was killed by fleance ,  because fleance fled .
were you listening to these verses ?
maria ,  take care of this poor fellow here .
what kind of scheme do you have going together ?
he abandoned his friend here in an emergency ,  and even pretended he didn’t know him .
i know she is a hateful ,  brawling scold .
listen !
he is worth more mourning than that ,  and i will mourn for him .
you’re pale and trembling .
i hope you think i’m faithful to you .
the dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
the moor !
what’s done is done.
is it gone ?
young child of treachery!
who does it ,  then ?
beg that you may have permission to hang yourself; and still, your wealth being the penalty to pay the state, you haven’t got the value of a string left; so you must be hanged at the state's expense.
i’ll pick berries for you .
and for that offence we immediately exile him from here .
otherwise i would have been perfect ,  as solid as a piece of marble ,  as firm as a rock ,  as free as the air itself .
oh most happy hour!
the king stays awake tonight and has a drinking party ,  keeps toasting ,  and the swaggering morning whirls ,  and ,  as he drinks down his drafts of rhine wine ,  the kettle - drum and trumpet thus noisily announce the triumph of his drinking it all down at once .
i’ll deliver the message .
that’s why he hates me .
what marvelous music !
let it be .
i’ll go call the watch .
i’ll think over what you’ve said ,  i’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say ,  and i’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters .
may i kiss your feet ?
god ,  if he who wrote the play had played pyramus ,  and hanged himself in thisbe's garter ,  it would have been a fine tragedy .
you’re a good judge of horsemanship .
let me shake your hands .
o my brother's child!
a friend should tolerate his friend's shortcomings, but brutus makes mine greater than they are.
a man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master ,  and when the right moment comes along ,  he’ll come or go as he pleases .
what do you mean by  “ carriages ”  ?
but come, i'll tell you all about my whole plan when i am in my coach, which waits for us at the park gate; and so hurry, because we must travel twenty miles today.
how long has she been like this ?
i'll go to the friar to know his solution.
is he attacking the heartland of poland or some frontier ?
if i live to see it ,  i’ll never trust his word again .
and her sister’s dead too ,  poisoned by your wife .
thieves!
is his ship sturdy ?
i had rather be a dog ,  and howl the moon ,  than be such a roman .
his kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
i guarantee you.
i'll look at him to like him, if, just by looking, i can like him, but i will not go any further than your consent gives my action strength to make it fly.
what ,  did he look like he was frowning ?
what, you speak drowsily.
you may have lost his respect ,  but so have i .
your name’s gloucester .
am i sorry that i only had one child ?
you’re standing .
the king, sir yes, sir, what about him?
i know i may be old ,  but i’m strong and healthy ,  because in my youth i never drank nor lived recklessly .
come, come, nerissa, because i long to see quick cupid's messenger that comes so politely.
if you leave like that ,  you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good - bye .
hate me!
oh ,  gods ,  give me patience !
the queen and her elves will be here soon .
mistress and master ,  you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with ,  the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with .
o day !
well, there has been a lot of comment on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy.
well ,  brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
but how is it possible that prospero’s alive and well and living on this island ?
servants ,  take these gentlemen to see hamlet .
up, sword, and know a more horrid intention.
that counts for everything .
go away; i'll send for you soon.
borachio .
good sir, why are you startled, and seem afraid of things that sound so beautiful?
when i talked about all these things ,  desdemona used to listen attentively .
our fathers' minds are dead ,  and we are governed by our mothers' spirits; our burden and suffering makes us look womanish .
do you really mean to go after this wildcat ?
would?
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard.
i kiss the instrument of their desires .
come, let's do so, because every minute is to expect more arrival.
yes ,  for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever .
petruchio ,  let’s stand over here awhile .
if he struggles ,  use force !
with those plays in mind ,  we hope you’ll receive this one kindly .
no ,  let me know; and knowing what i am ,  i know what she shall be .
he deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men i’ve ever seen .
i’ll do it .
this wind you talk of blows us from our party crashing .
well ,  then ,  we’re awake .
i hope my noble lord believes i am faithful.
no ,  in truth ,  sir ,  he should not .
well that’s good .
then if he loses ,  it’ll be his swan song ,  music before the end .
as i !
dove-feathered raven!
please, my king, be quiet.
have you heard any news of impending battle ?
i know you for what you really are ,  but as your sister i’m reluctant to criticize you .
it is too rough ,  too rude ,  too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn .
i hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again .
why ,  what are you afraid of ?
hamlet has polonius slain in insanity ,  and he has dragged him from his mother's bedroom .
my father is not dead ,  is all you’re saying .
come on in ,  con man .
didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
will his billing bill him no more for his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of property liens?
i'll send my prayers with him.
and did you leave him like this ?
and you’re all sizzle .
with all my heart . —three or four of you go welcome him . —in the meantime ,  i’ll read bellario’s letter out loud .
damned iago !
come on ,  let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up .
i’m coming ,  don’t worry .
my own flesh and blood turned against me !
you will be less than macbeth, and much greater.
monday, my lord.
we will have vengeance for it ,  don’t worry about that .
he said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
old lord ,  i can’t blame you .
yes ,  my lord .
you lie.
go as fast as you can .
why ,  what’s the matter ?
well done, my bird.
be calm ,  dear lady .
if you love me then, sneaker away from your father's house tomorrow night; and, in the forest, three miles outside town, where i met you once, with helena, to celebrate a may day morning party, i will wait for you there.
well ,  i’ll get married one day ,  just to see .
then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven .
what shall i say?
so i recommend you take note of what i’m about to say .
you’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart ,  making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be) . —and ,  my gracious duke ,  if she won’t agree to marry demetrius right now ,  i ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in athens .
good night, lord brutus.
good job ,  my little one .
hum !
you know me well, and waste time here to twist a story about my friendship with examples; and, no doubt, you insult me by questioning the limits of my friendship as if you had wasted everything i have.
i don’t like games; i lack some part of that quick spirit that antony has.
our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here ,  you come with me ,  and even though i leave here ,  i stay with you .
if you forgive us ,  we’ll make everything all right .
i know a lady in venice who’d walk all the way to palestine for a kiss from him .
it’s incredible—they didn’t say a word .
there is only one mind in all these men ,  and it is bent against caesar .
i’ll get it done right away .
monster ,  i smell all horse - piss ,  at which my nose is highly offended .
i learned to do this from you .
what if it tempts you toward the ocean ,  my lord ,  or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that hangs so threateningly over his base into the sea ,  and once there ,  assumes some other horrible form which might deprive you of the ability to think ,  and draw you into madness ?
flute ,  the bellows - mender !
go to; farewell .
now ,  no more questions .
how unlucky am i ,  having to apologize for doing the right thing !
the gods can hear you lying !
your children shall be kings .
he’s busy ,  can’t you hear him giving orders ?
by my birth i rank above you ,  but don’t be afraid of my greatness .
to get my poor ,  mad husband out from inside there .
feeling the loss so much ,  i can’t help but weep for the friend forever .
things are what they are .
yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
there was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
this night.
so you shall have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i would now have to advance them; and the impediment very profitably removed ,  without which we couldn’t expect to succeed .
lord hamlet!
yes, that's certain.
heavens protect him from these beasts!
let him approach.
i never offended him at all .
these ones ,  then ,  will be assassinated .
a veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
don’t think of any beauty but the beauty of rosalind .
really ,  cousin ,  it’s him .
it is lodovico come from the duke .
make room for antony ,  most noble antony !
is it possible ?
go ,  bring him here ,  boy .
here ,  peter quince .
the two of them were separated during the storm .
he’ll find out soon what happened in england .
have you both really given me up ?
call him over here ,  good monsieur le beau .
you understand me, yes?
it is the east, and juliet is the sun rising!
he likes me very well, and i have given him cause to; just send him here, and i'll train him.
good morning ,  neighbor baptista .
and then ,  i hope ,  you’ll be satisfied .
couldn’t you take some opportunity without my giving you one?
i brought news of juliet's death to my master, and then he came from mantua, by horse, to this same place, to this same tomb.
my old bones are tired .
but he says he still loves and respects you ,  and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back .
you guide me on the way that i was going ,  and show me the instrument i was to use .
a certain group of educated worms are now biting him .
heaven's face glows— yes, this solid and compound body with a trustful face— as against the end of the world, is sickened by the thought of the act.
a fortunate coincidence—more fortunate for your son .
this lantern represents the horned moon; i myself seem to be the man in the moon .
the ambassadors from norway ,  my good lord ,  are joyfully returned .
am i that name ,  iago ?
now ,  you know how i love you has been proven to you ,  and as my love is cannot be measured ,  so is my fear .
yes, you have seen cassio and her together.
i will only say one more word here in the house ,  and i’ll go with you .
believe me ,  then ,  that i have special powers .
yes ,  she did tell us .
come on then ,  let's go to bed .
oh ,  my poor brother !
come one, woman!
the world is a bad place ,  where you can’t speak what you know .
but don’t be too tame either ,  but let your own discretion be your teacher .
never ,  my lord .
i don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul .
nothing but  “ little ”  and  “ short ”  ! — why are you letting her insult me like this ?
will we be separated ?
god, if he who wrote the play had played pyramus, and hanged himself in thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy.
that you love my daughter to spite your soul .
so i’ve begged him to come along with us to watch what happens this night ,  that ,  if this apparition comes again ,  he may believe what we have seen and speak to it .
here comes the man: give the present to him, father; because i am a jew, if i serve the jew any longer.
their forces are nearby .
she would hang on to him ,  and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him .
just remember to grab his books first ,  since without them he’s just a poor fool like me ,  and can’t command a single spirit .
so if four negatives make two affirmatives ,  i’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
he did ,  my lord .
gentlemen ,  let’s go make sure cassio’s wounds are properly dressed . —come on ,  ma'am ,  you can tell us another story .
hey ,  what’s this ,  adam ?
and i see a lot of orlando here .
most mighty caesar ,  let me know some reason ,  in case i’m laughed at when i tell them so .
tell him he’s not going to speak with me .
no ,  no ,  put your hat back on .
jailer ,  keep an eye on him .
he’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
trinculo ,  run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word more and ,  i swear ,  i'll turn you out of doors ,  and make a dried fish out of you .
what does the silver one say ?
there are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again .
my language!
who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king ?
lock him in ,  so he can play the fool in his own home only .
sweet portia, if you knew to whom i gave the ring, if you knew for whom i gave the ring, and would think about for what i gave the ring, and how unwillingly i let the ring go, when nothing would be accepted but the ring, you would decrease the strength of your anger.
sounds good to us .
i’ll hire you again to go back to rome .
my heart journeyed to her only like a guest, and now has returned home to helena, there to remain.
i can remember the past seventy years pretty well ,  and in all that time i have seen dreadful hours and strange things .
i’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .
still ,  did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her ?
but don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
the courtier's ,  scholar's ,  soldier's ,  eye ,  voice ,  sword ,  the hope and flower of denmark ,  the mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form ,  the observed of all observers ,  quite ,  quite taken down !
i remember very well where i should be ,  and here i am .
so is my horse ,  octavius ,  and for that ,  i appoint him keeper of the hay .
i myself am the king of naples ,  since i saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck .
how are you ,  my lord ?
look here,“ he said, “did you fall on your face?
the will !
let’s go in; and ask us all your questions ,  and we’ll answer everything truthfully .
brutus has torn my heart.
a beautiful voice ,  i swear .
tell me that .
what ,  did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
what could you possibly ask for ?
he's having a fit now and doesn’t talk sense .
coming from sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our former ensign, and they perched there, gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands; who were associated with us here in philippi.
for the sake of your father’s memory ,  make peace .
fly, good fleance, fly, fly, fly!
agreed .
will you tell me that ?
is that what he says ?
the wind is right and it’s high tide ,  and i’ve delayed him a long time already .
alas ,  why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
oh ,  wine is the devil !
fathers who wear rags make their children neglect them .
then let god grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed .
well ,  then it isn’t one to you ,  since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it .
feeling the loss so much, i can’t help but weep for the friend forever.
ah ,  you sorceress !
must i stand and bend under your short-tempered mood?
the morning is coming .
one more time ,  we proclaim this publicly: if anyone will pay this man’s bail ,  he will not be put to death .
you know that i strongly held epicurus, and his opinion.
but let this speaking be done now ,  even while men's minds are wild ,  lest more mischance on plots and errors happen .
i headed toward him ,  but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
think that you are a baby ,  that you have taken these offers for true love ,  which are not true offers .
yes ,  madam ,  only to return again tonight .
before your sentence has been completed ?
how dare you trade and traffic with macbeth in riddles and affairs of death; and i, the mistress of your charms, the secret contriver of all harms, was never called to offer my part, or show the glory of our art?
what’s the matter ?
call help .
oh ,  antony ,  antony ,  antony !
good running ,  thisbe !
read your history !
o horror ,  horror ,  horror !
aside .
even if i went to church and saw the holy building of stone, i’d be thinking right away about dangerous rocks, which, touching only my gentle vessel's side, would scatter all her spices across the water, spreading my silk cargo across the roaring waters, and, in a word, one minute worth this amount of money, and now worth nothing.
go, one of you, and call the jew into the court.
so awake when i am gone; for i must go now to oberon.
how are you ,  guildenstern ?
caesar might act like that .
i’ll remember .
friend, look to it.
look in the almanac .
i told him we’ll stay for at least a month ,  and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer .
i did so ,  and i went even further ,  which is now the point of our second meeting .
soldiers ,  watch carefully .
gone?
stay, and speak!
i should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it ,  but you started fighting with me first .
what did you say ?
and let’s swear our determination .
i’m already here ,  sir .
a south - west wind blow on you ,  and blister you all over !
this castle is in a pleasant place .
we have to give up and let him go .
i shall ,  king harry .
come in out of the storm .
by mary ,  that  “ marry ”  is what i want to talk about .
i think one of them is nearby and can’t get away .
between whom ?
no ,  my brutus; you’ve got some sick worry on your mind ,  which ,  by the right and virtue of my place ,  i ought to know of ,  and ,  on my knees ,  i order you ,  by my once commended beauty ,  by all your vows of love ,  and that marriage vow which joined us and made us one ,  that you tell me ,  yourself ,  your half of me ,  why you’re so depressed ,  and what men have come to you tonight ,  because there have been some six or seven here ,  who hid their faces even from darkness .
and yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
i'll swear on that bottle to be your true subject, because that liquor is not earthly.
he’s calling us back .
why, what do i care?
i shouldn’t make you do your duty past your strength; i know young bloods look for time of rest.
right ,  and they wore proclamations around their necks ,  saying ,   “ be it known to all men by these  the eldest of the three brothers wrestled with charles ,  the duke’s wrestler .
a full half hour.
are you a man?
i wish i had been there.
and, gentle puck, take this donkey head off the head of this athenian lover, that when he wakes when the others do, all of them may go back to athens, thinking no more about tonight’s events than that they were parts of a dream.
it’s absolutely true ,  so take good care of it .
but woo her ,  gentle paris ,  get her love .
shame on you !
general, be careful; he comes with bad intentions.
three thousand dollars; right ?
his father was philip of macedon ,  as i remember .
this is the voice of friar john .
although i can’t make his ship disappear ,  i can still make his journey miserable .
sweet lord, you lie to me.
yawn ,  snore .
lain .
this honest creature undoubtedly sees and knows more ,  much more ,  than he reveals .
do you carry a pike ?
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven?
we’re men beached on the sand ,  hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
weakness, your name is woman — a little month, even before those shoes with which she followed my poor father's body were old, she was totally inconsolable, all tears, why she, even she— o god!
is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye ?
the general and his wife are talking about it now ,  and she’s defending you strongly .
and now you decide to call a holiday?
you, mistress, that have the office next to saint peter, and keep the gate of hell!
my lord ,  he's going to his mother's bedroom .
two months ago ,  there was a gentleman from normandy here ,  i’ve seen myself ,  and served against the french ,  and they can do well on horseback ,  but this gallant had witchcraft in it .
enough.
you had this child with the help of heaven .
i beg you, see there!
you smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven ,  while i cried salty tears into the salty sea ,  and groaned at our situation .
so ,  goodbye now ,  because brutus' tongue has almost ended his life's story .
but i still believe the source and beginning of his grief began with rejected love .
how did you like the young german ,  the duke of saxony’s nephew ?
i wish you had never seen him!
how is it, general?
go ,  nurse ,  go with her .
help, angels!
truly, a peck of dry food; i could munch your good dry oats.
well ,  i’ll get going and so deliver these papers as you asked me .
caesar brought many captives home to rome ,  whose ransoms filled the national treasury .
if it were me ,  i’d be very upset too .
this is how god forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
yes, boy, ready.
why ,  this was modeled on a porridge bowl !
but didn’t you expect us to cut the cloth ?
who’s winning ?
speak ,  i am obliged to listen .
you are too over-zealous on her behalf that rejects your services.
yes ,  but these english are seriously short of beef .
what ,  the fair ophelia ?
you aren’t joking?
dear maid, kind sister, sweet ophelia!
what a jaunt i have had!
no, let me praise you while i want to.
but never mind them—if caesar had stabbed their mothers ,  they would’ve forgiven him .
casca ,  you’re the first one to strike .
and her cook yelled ,  mocked ,  and teased me ,  right ?
i wish i knew what is happening .
give me your hand.
you often scolded me for loving rosaline .
watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
run ,  run ,  oh ,  run !
he has called for his horse ,  but i don’t know where he’s headed .
i wish the night were here already !
nonsense, i’m in their hearts, and i know why they do it.
tell me the truth.
when she put it on my finger ,  she made me swear never to sell it ,  give it away ,  or lose it .
my lady ,  should i lie in your lap ?
come ,  find the conspirators .
as i sat on the shore crying over my father’s shipwreck ,  i heard the music creep over the wild waves ,  calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies .
we three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
and you shall speak after my speech is ended on the same platform where i’m going to be .
we will hear more of this story later . — egeus ,  i will override your demands; these couples shall eternally be knit by and by with us in the temple .
to the forest of arden ,  to find your father .
but quiet !
i will say it for you .
your wife would give you little thanks for that, if she were here to listen to such an offer.
i’ll follow in the center of the troop formation ,  which i’ll defend with my best horse ,  and with saint george on my side ,  as well !
oh ,  so you’d give me all your tediousness ?
a dog ,  a rat ,  a mouse ,  a cat ,  to scratch a man to death !
what traitor hears me and doesn’t say amen ?
here it is .
i mean ,  sir ,  in delaying our entrance ,  we waste our lights in vain ,  like lamps by day .
i swear that gown’s for me .
death and damnation!
peter, stay at the gate.
it is short, my lord.
i guarantee you .
it is a creature that dotes on cassio, as it is the whore's disease to trick many and be tricked by one.
that’s why i wish my sister didn’t have a name ,  sir .
look here ,  “  he said ,   “ did you fall on your face ?
you look like a person who knows the business of war .
ah me!
oh ,  a thousand of them ,  all of which i’ve forgotten .
oh ,  i’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !
if this is so ,  be patient ,  sister .
speak ,  speak !
good sentences, and well said.
i wish my daughter were dead at my foot ,  and the jewels in her ear; i wish she were trained at my feet ,  and the dollars in her coffin !
the three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home .
and may .
then she is well ,  and nothing is wrong .
we’ll outwit them all—that old geezer ,  gremio; the suspicious father ,  minola; the prim musician lover ,  litio—all for the sake of my master ,  lucentio .
i don’t care .
by god ,  i order you to speak .
what’s the prize ?
well ,  the  shall we get moving ?
ariel ,  you’ve done your work exactly as i ordered .
she has been in a man’s bed .
you’re not conquered .
they only like things as bad as themselves .
this isn’t brutus ,  friend ,  but ,  i assure you ,  a prize no less worthy .
weren’t you sent for?
where are you ,  pindarus ?
i have no knowledge of the king-becoming graces, such as justice, verity, temperance, stableness, bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, but i only abound in the division of each several crime, acting it many ways.
that light is not daylight ,  i know it .
indeed ,  you would be out if i were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
it’s a deal .
he doesn’t know yet about his honorable fortune.
can you tell me whether one launcelot, who lives with him, lives with him or not?
what’s going on now about this haunted grove?
indeed i should have asked you that before.
your wife and babies savagely slaughtered .
this is the place .
get up ,  i say .
if i repeated it to you ,  it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
come down .
yes, so he says.
will you cry about your cousin’s death forever ?
we both obey, and here we give up ourselves, without reservation, to lay our service freely at your feet, to be commanded.
ah me !
stinking like a swamp .
god be with you, sir.
tell him we could have driven him back at harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened .
what’s up ,  roderigo !
what, are you busy, hello?
you have nothing to be afraid of ,  my lord; i’ll do it .
i anger her sometimes, and tell her that paris is the more proper man; but i'll guarantee you, when i say so, she looks as pale as any linen in the whole, wide world.
by all the gods that romans bow before, i here discard my sickness.
find out what this villainous edgar is thinking ,  edmund .
that’s where we’ll meet with macbeth.
what ,  you look amused .
i swear on my life that i’m speaking the truth .
then let’s go in and hear what he has to say—though i think i can guess before the frenchman has uttered a word .
what follows ,  then ,  my lord ?
i am glad it’s night so that you can’t see me ,  because i am very ashamed of my costume; but love is blind ,  and lovers cannot see the pretty mischief that they themselves commit ,  because ,  if they could ,  cupid himself would blush to see me transformed to a boy like this .
we will sit here and let the sounds of music creep into our ears; soft stillness and the night compliment the touches of sweet harmony.
if this were a play ,  i’d complain it was unrealistic .
do you mark that ?
not i, my lord, by heaven.
dear love, goodbye!
three months from twelve; then let me see the rate.
the testament!
no marrying among his subjects ?
they’re looking for you in the great chamber .
thank you .
i will play it in either your straw - color beard ,  your orange - tawny beard ,  your purple - in - grain beard ,  or your french - crown - color beard ,  your perfect yellow .
and we’ll leave together ,  like friends .
but please ,  therefore ,  old man ,  therefore ,  i beg you ,  are you talking about young master launcelot ?
this news will comfort cassius .
and we’ll hear it.
stop, take this letter.
i'll tell the news.
othello ,  i’ve been seriously hurt .
to kill him ,  clitus .
more ,  please ,  more .
take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude ,  not as a fee .
what’s new with you ?
the english force, so please you.
hated potion, get away!
i won’t lodge any more than that under my roof .
good night, good night!
keep an eye on cinna .
tell me but this ,  haven’t you sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand ?
most horrible !
dark as hell ,  sir topas .
do you think so ,  spirit ?
i say i love you more than he does.
what ,  an argument already ?
my mistress ,  ”  i said .
o ,  that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace !
wait ,  don’t stand next to each other .
because if that’s the case ,  i will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me .
pull them apart .
look ,  here she comes !
an era of universal peace is about to start .
why then ,  it is like this: you must prepare your chest for his knife .
stop ,  oh !
many times, you’ve climbed up to the walls and lookout posts, to the towers and windows, yes, to chimney tops, your infants in your arms, and you’ve sat there the entire day, waiting patiently to see great pompey pass through the streets of rome.
but, to my thinking, he was very reluctant to remove his fingers off it.
goodbye ,  sir .
good!
o cassius, brutus gave the word too early, who, having some advantage on octavius, took it too eagerly.
to see an elderly ,  unlucky merchant from syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to ephesus .
sweet moon ,  i thank you for your sunny beams .
if he said so, may his evil soul rot half a grain a day!
that’s enough .
it’s all right ,  since they left their food behind ,  and we’re hungry .
give me my sin back .
isn’t she proud?
if love is blind, love can’t find the spot.
is all the conversation that we two have shared ,  the sisters' vows ,  the hours that we have spent ,  when we have scolded the clock for parting us , —oh ,  is it all forgotten ?
you cannot, unless my heart were in your hand, and that won’t happen while it is in my custody.
well ,  more in a minute .
do i know these men that come along with you ?
listen !
the duke of york sends your majesty his respects .
will you, strato?
it surprises me as much as my joy to see you here before me.
perhaps there’s still some poison on them ,  to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
come, for england!
pitiful situation!
what was the last cry for ?
my king, they haven’t come back yet.
i shouldn’t see the time pass in the sands of an hour - glass but i’d be thinking about shallows and sandbars ,  and seeing my wealthy ship of war run aground ,  lowering her high top sails lower than her hull to sink .
put this poison into any liquid you want ,  and drink it all; and ,  if you had the strength of twenty men ,  it would kill you right away .
here are forty ducats .
four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster !
curse my very heart ,  i think you will be happy in this second marriage ,  for it surpasses your first .
march to the bridge .
you must take your chance, and either don’t attempt to choose at all, or swear before you choose that, if you choose wrong, you will never to speak to me afterward about marriage; so be advised.
what wood is this before us?
adieu .
the moor's abused by some very villainous rogue ,  some base notorious rogue ,  some scurvy fellow .
we will follow you .
besides ,  his cottage ,  his flocks ,  and his grazing rights are on sale now ,  and since he’s not there ,  there’s nothing to eat at our house .
no ,  caesar doesn’t have it; but you ,  and i ,  and honest casca ,  we have epilepsy .
i'll go and chat with paris.
scorn and defiance ,  indifference ,  contempt ,  and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you .
could he dig without arms?
were you ever at court ,  shepherd ?
that’s the point .
so what if i killed her husband and her father ?
we’ll leave you here .
yes ,  you have to tell us why ,  sir andrew .
and, england, if you hold my love at anything, as my great power may give you some sense, since your scar still looks raw and red after the danish sword, and your open fear pays homage to us, you might not view our sovereign process coldly, which gives you full power, by letters testifying to that effect, the present death of hamlet.
i’d have stayed until i had made you happy ,  if worthier friends hadn’t stopped me .
your dinner and the generous islanders you invited, wait for your presence.
i think it’s later than that, sir.
certainly, men should be what they seem.
you’re wrong ,  you madman .
good god ,  i was about to say something .
i hope heaven protects him from the weather ,  because i lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
i’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
not for you either.
your eyes are like stars ,  and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime .
why should he call her whore?
come ,  a passionate speech .
you’re going to make me jealous ,  launcelot ,  if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this !
ok, that’s fine.
come ,  let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
good friend, go to him; because, by this light of heaven, i don’t know how i lost him.
night, hide me awhile.
get out of my sight !
are you riding far ?
take them in.
at five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it .
i can’t speak anymore .
my love!
exactly right .
draws .
why, lamb!
so will you confess ,  i am sure ,  that you love me .
just read it .
what did you enact?
o heaven !
will you go hide ?
his silly behavior, helena, is not my fault.
who are the people who want to speak with me ?
i’d rather die .
i told him you were asleep .
his name's gonzago.
what can possibly fix this situation ?
on, lusty gentlemen!
i agree .
their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
not life ,  but love in death !
words before fighting .
if you’re someone who gets into fights ,  i’ll fight with you .
be free and happy .
nature has made it so that i can see through your chest all the way to your heart .
come ,  sir ,  no more . —oswald ,  come here !
a soldier is just a tool ,  like his sword ,  unless he has your qualities ,  ventidius .
no ,  not charge interest; not ,  as you would say ,  directly charge interest; listen to what jacob did .
what play?
i’m not lear .
where are those bastards ?
am i to come near you now?
they’ll kill us !
it was a painful bruise ,  and she was crying bitterly .
no, the clock has already struck twelve.
is it a free visit ?
let’s go .
this is the night that either makes me or breaks me.
can i go away while my heart stays here ?
it was armed ,  you say ?
one word more shall make me scold you ,  if not hate you .
here’s mine .
work on ,  my medicine ,  work !
he thinks  “ g ”  is me .
i don’t love hermia; i love helena .
you are welcome here .
what’s that good for ?
for michael cassio, i would swear i think that he is honest.
follow her .
that is laertes, a very noble youth.
when devoutly religious men are praying ,  it’s hard to draw them out of it ,  because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation .
the glowworm shows the morning is near ,  and he begins to put out his ineffective fire .
please go back to goneril’s house .
now that’s patience !
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket ,  and give it his son as an apple .
o heart as black as death!
why do you complain about your birth ,  the heavens ,  and the earth ?
ah ,  my good old friends !
so do we all .
their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
what a horrible slut !
are you a suitor to the girl we speak of ,  yes or no ?
speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied; cry but “ah me!” pronounce but “love” and “dove;” speak one fair word to my godmother venus, one nickname for her almost blind son and heir, young auburn cupid, he that shot the arrow so well when king cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
whichever of you acts shy ,  i’ll swear she has corns .
this little prank of hers is going to cost me .
the gods forbid !
i will die and leave him my entire estate .
as faithful as flies in rotting meat ,  which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
go with my brothers to my english peers .
disgusting !
caesar ,  you cannot die by traitors' hands ,  unless you bring them with you .
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rare breath ?
what’s going on ,  borachio ?
what kind of man are you ?
oh ,  shut up .
have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together ,  the vows we made to be like sisters to one another ,  all the hours we spent together ,  wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten ?
how hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience!
hold him in custody until the prince gets here .
oh nature ,  what were you doing in hell ?
here it is ,  i think .
against my brother lucius ?
just notice .
in places i go to, great clerks have purposed to greet me with prepared welcomes; i have seen them shiver and look pale, make full stops in the middle of sentences, mess up their practiced speeches in their fears, and, in conclusion, stop all together, dumbstruck, not paying me a welcome.
so, now you're paid.
but ,  my lord ,  his majesty asked me to tell you that he has placed a great wager on your head .
he’s not here .
for i never saw true beauty till this night .
who started it this time?
you all loved him once , —not without reason .
separate them .
i think someone’s coming from venice .
these blazes ,  daughter ,  giving more light than heat ,  dead in both ,  even in their promises ,  dying as they are being made ,  must not be taken for real fire .
what ,  here in the middle of the street ?
change course, my brain!
good .
that’s how it was with henry the sixth ,  who was crowned in paris when he was only nine months old .
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave you, you gave to cassio.
so good night to everyone .
but he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy .
why ,  light is a function of discovering things ,  love ,  and i should be hidden .
the coroner’s inquest law .
lady !
a man’s virtues will always show themselves ,  and that’s the end of that .
brother— quiet .
i’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in illyria .
madam, not yet; but there is come a messenger ahead of them, to show that they are coming.
and i have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love .
i ,  fight against you ,  antony ?
we’re all lost!
when?
nonsense ,  i’m in their hearts ,  and i know why they do it .
let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
if not ,  then this parting was well done .
it is .
aside.
the person who suffers alone suffers the most .
away, skinny man!
i know our country’s disposition well; in venice they let heaven see the pranks they wouldn’t dare show their husbands; their best conscience isn’t to leave it unfinished, but to keep it unknown.
well ,  old man ,  i’ll tell you news of your son .
that was my lady's voice.
why are you breathless ,  and why are you staring like that ?
my lord ,  you’re wrong to berate her like that .
i have turned enemy to my own.
was a man ever as dirty as me ?
catch me ,  catch me ,  wife .
if i ever loved her ,  all that love is gone .
commend me to your honorable wife: tell her the story of antonio's end; say how i loved you; speak fairly about me in death; and, when the tale is told, ask her to be the judge of whether bassanio didn’t once have a love.
cobble you ,  sir .
yes, you would argue for a score of kingdoms, and i would call it fair play.
it might ,  my lord .
the total due is about three ducats more than i owe this gentleman .
order his death immediately ,  and ,  with the traitor’s former title ,  greet macbeth .
are you coming again for ransom ?
then you can hear my news ,  as dessert .
have you told him all her faults ,  hortensio ?
but let me try my luck on the boxes .
if such tricks as these strip you of your lieutenantry, it would’ve been better you hadn’t kissed your three fingers so often, with which you are again very ready to play the gent.
as you like this, give me the lie again.
they wash his wounds with tears .
i wish my father could see with my eyes.
o dissolving soul, that, struggling to be free, is more a slave!
we’re all lost !
and i will give you some more .
oh, why do you reject him that loves you so?
welcome ,  good marcellus .
what kind of a man are you!
where are they?
tomorrow ,at your earliest, let me speak with you.
if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear what i have to say ,  i shall beg him to take care of himself .
i recognize his trumpet .
tomorrow i’ll send the messenger .
my name's macbeth.
in law, what plea is so tainted and corrupt that, being delivered with a gracious voice, obscures the evil underneath?
i made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that i could keep a hundred knights of my own .
and for that purpose, i’ll poison my sword.
i would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
his old sword, rebelling against his arm, lies where it falls, resisting his commands.
it’s true .
it’s my exercise time .
indeed!
here comes the man: give the present to him ,  father; because i am a jew ,  if i serve the jew any longer .
and i won’t draw from my own weak merits the smallest fear or doubt of her turning against me, because she had eyes and chose me.
this is too long.
you say right, sir.
the queen is dead ,  my lord .
goodbye ,  then .
who are you ?
i couldn’t stay behind after you left .
it makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested .
so i ,  wall ,  have discharged my part; and ,  being done ,  wall goes away like this .
nice save !
halt, and identify yourself.
forever and forever goodbye, brutus!
i won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore .
get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up .
and maybe a third ?
gentleman ,  i am not the same man i was before .
i don’t know what to say .
pray heavens he is, because i have served him, and the man commands like a full soldier.
but wait a minute .
respect caesar's corpse, and respect his speech about caesar's glory, which mark antony is allowed to make with our permission.
i see a voice; now i’ll go to the chink ,  to spy if i can hear my thisbe's face .
o grace !
tomorrow i’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved ,  in having what he wished for .
i know he will be happy at our success: we are the jasons, we have won the fleece.
lighten up .
and could you please take my servant to old shylock’s house ?
here's to my love!
also add a tiger's guts, for the ingredients of our caldron.
i will put my arms around you just as the woodbine twists around the sweet honeysuckle,— like the female ivy winds around the branches of the elm.
i have to stay with the servants ,  who are with our camp’s luggage .
i'll follow ,  stephano .
if he resists ,  subdue him at his peril .
damn it all to hell !
wretched queen, goodbye!
how did her eyes get so bright ?
on the ground!
could you really do such a thing ,  for all the world ?
nothing .
did you notice ?
she has disarmed me .
even if i had a whole bunch of mouths ,  i wouldn’t be able to answer that .
what are you accused of ?
her father and i ,  lawful spies ,  will so hide ourselves that ,  seeing but unseen ,  we may honestly judge their encounter ,  and gather from him ,  or how he behaves ,  if it’s the affliction of his love or not that he suffers like this for .
still ,  don’t be afraid scotland has harvests enough to satisfy you ,  of your very own .
most noble brother ,  you have done me wrong .
my own safety is the only important thing now .
and i his clerk; so be well advised how you leave me to my own protection .
everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
think ,  my lord !
what should i say ,  sweet lady ?
that he has used you.
i didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with mistress shore .
is she enclosed in silver ,  which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up with, and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because of him.
he’s fainted !
there are some harsh contents in that letter that steal the color from bassanio's cheeks: some dear friend is dead, or nothing else in the world could change the constitution so much of any constant man.
can you love the gentleman?
therefore ,  let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
why ,  fool ?
i’ll attack you now !
get going!
love goes toward love as schoolboy away from their books; but love goes from love, like boys towards school with heavy looks.
do the deed that will make this island yours forever ,  and will make me ,  caliban ,  your worshipful foot - licker .
and how would we go about doing that ?
this works out better than i could have planned .
your lips are warm!
to cut his throat in the church.
but you’re not quickly motivated to hit.
look over your lines again .
so i’ll stay here for a while .
i will play it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your french-crown-color beard, your perfect yellow.
don’t say no .
listen ,  i’m going home tomorrow ,  sir toby .
i have no idea, my lord.
now let me see if i can translate it .
when the blood is made calm with playing ,  there should be something to fire it up again and to satisfy a fresh appetite ,  loveliness in favor; sympathy in years ,  manners ,  and beauties ,  all which the moor lacks .
i don’t even know how much i’m spending to find them .
let me say first ,  madam ,  that he is well .
have you met with him?
what worse place can i beg in your love, and still keep my self-respect — than to be used as you would use your dog?
oh ,  goodbye to my peace of mind !
by my count ,  i was already your mother at just about your age ,  while you remain a virgin .
and trust me, love, in my eyes, so do you.
if you really love me ,  you’ll find me . —nerissa and the rest of you ,  get away from him .
o, find him!
like the  oh stop it ,  you lusty bed - hopper .
so please your grace, the prologue is next.
madam !
what do you mean by this haunting of me ?
it’s my men who should call me  “ lord .  ”  i’m your man ,  your fellow .
now, before god, i am so annoyed that every part about me quivers.
we will take the next advantage thoroughly.
my good lords ,  i plan to .
he was wrong to do that .
sleep for a week, because tonight, i guarantee, count paris has set up his rest so that you shall rest but little.
but ,  oh ,  heavenly rosalind !
each new morning ,  new widows howl ,  new orphans cry ,  new sorrows strike heaven on the face so that it echoes as if it felt scotland’s pain ,  and yelled out like a sigh of sorrow .
where do i live ?
none that i know definitely ,  but i’m very afraid there’s a chance .
excuse me ,  weren’t you with countess olivia just now ?
what has caesar done to deserve your love ?
i do see a kind of hope, which requires a plan as desperate as that event we want to prevent.
may the gods be with you .
i’d never heard such raucous music ,  such pleasant thunder .
get out of my sight ! —i guess if she doesn’t love her father ,  then i’ll only have peace when i’m dead . —call the king of france .
tell your wife to watch her .
yes ,  i swear .
son ,  i’ll stake you half that bianca comes .
the hay .
whether i go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
what!
do you want to get married ,  fool ?
do you recognize my voice ,  noble lord ?
let’s speak to him .
is the army without a leader ?
you’ve forgotten the will i told you of .
i say, to buy his good will, i extend this friendship; if he will take it, okay; if not, goodbye; and, for my friendship, please don’t insult me.
listen, can you hear me?
it is better with you out here than he inside the hall .
that’s not necessary .
remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done .
this is too long .
i don’t think he wants to be disturbed .
heaven bless us!
o horror, horror, horror!
no ,  noble mistress; it is fresh morning with me when you are near at night .
but, o grief, where have you taken me?
i don’t like to see misery over - played ,  and duty dying in his service .
where is your husband?
the old rooster .
tell me that.
well then ,  it now appears you need my help; come on ,  then; you come to me ,  and you say  “ 'shylock ,  we would have money .  ”  you say so: you that spit on my beard ,  and kick me as you spurn a strange dog on your doorstep; money is what you ask for .

please ,  sir ,  be quiet .
a double blessing is a double grace, it’s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again.
i didn’t call for you.

a governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by ,  and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody .
i did ,  my lord .

signior tranio ,  you also took aim at that bird ,  though you didn’t hit her . —so here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed .

you thief of love !
look at the calendar ,  and come back and tell me .
here he comes ,  my lord .

if he awakens, he'll fill our skins with pinches from toe to head; turn us into strange stuff.
i saw that .
scurvy knave!
you didn’t want to go then !
i’m going to make sure i stay on your good side ,  lady .
in a town of war still waging ,  the people's hearts brimful of fear ,  to control private and domestic quarrels ,  at night ,  and on the court and guard of safety !
yes ,  my lord .
he’s called modo and mahu .
he liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me .
what kind of manners is it to go to a grave before your father ?
tell me .
and, so his death bell is rung.
get out !
and then ,  i admit ,  he may do danger ,  at his will ,  with a sting that we put in him .

valentine’s day is over .
i know that young men look forward to their rest .
i only believe part of it, because my spirit is fresh, and i am resolved to meet all perils very constantly.
i am young, only something you may deserve of him through me, and wisdom to offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb to appease an angry god.
speak, i am obliged to listen.
i’ll have none of your money .

big ,  round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose .
here is a letter ,  lady ,  the paper is like the body of my friend ,  and every word in it ,  a gaping wound bleeding heavily .
if hamlet gives the first or second hit, or quits in answer of the third exchange, let all the battlements fire their ammunition, the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath, and in the cup he shall throw a pearl, richer than that which four successive kings have worn in denmark's crown.
shame on you !

the captain—give it to the captain .
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo ,  by my bad voice .
well, we march on, to give obedience where it is truly owed.
what ,  shall we go ?
we don’t intend to harm you ,  or any other roman .

o mischief, you are quick to enter into the thoughts of desperate men!
i’ve locked it up in my room .
let the envoy from antony come in .
here was a caesar!

that tree could be called god’s tree ,  since it drops such wonderful fruit .
why ,  friends ,  you go ahead to do you don’t know what .
take out your sword .
making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
please, sir, go: my young master expects your insult.
don’t listen to the bell ,  duncan ,  because it summons you either to heaven or to hell .
are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
what was the last cry for ?
it’s not offensive ,  is it ?
don’t worry about me .
and so do i too, lieutenant.
what my lord said i was .
it looks just like the dead king!
have you forgotten the torture i freed you from ?
yes ,  hamlet .

oh earth ,  which soaks up this blood ,  revenge his death !
how much does he owe the jew?
sleep rock your brain, and may misfortune never mischance between us two!
o my prophetic soul !
words without thoughts never go to heaven .
or ask you to leave the room ?
consider how young you are ,  and question your feelings .
assume ,  as it were ,  that you have only heard about him ,  such as ,   “ i know his father and his friends ,  and in part him ”  ,  are you listening to me ,  reynaldo ?
there is a play tonight before the king .
who builds stronger than a mason ,  a shipbuilder ,  or a carpenter ?
do so .
light the candles !

let’s hear him .
my daughter married death .
yes ,  as kind as snow to a harvest .
where’s the gold i gave you ?
it is .
you know i say nothing to him, because he doesn’t understand me, and i don’t understand him: he doesn’t know latin, french, or italian, and you will come into the court and swear that i only know a penny’s worth of english.
tut ,  tut ,  you’ve become rather icy .
your case is better.
i’d send seven of my servants to go get him .
if you can’t answer it— go ahead !
we will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
my lord ,  i did intend to ask .
but caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage ,  and so should you .
i did it while he was sleeping , —that is finished too , — and the athenian woman by his side ,  so that ,  when he woke up ,  she must ,  of course ,  be the first he saw .
oh ,  pardon me for bringing this bad news ,  but you told me it was my job ,  sir .
she doesn’t dare lie near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
here .
sir ,  i think i have the right to speak ,  and speak i certainly will .
when i was putting on the ceres show ,  i thought of reminding you about caliban ,  but i was afraid of upsetting you .
what ,  do you think we’re turks or savages ,  instead of christians ?
at least we'll die with armor on our back.
curse your families !
come ,  let’s have one more extravagant night .
o ,  he's a lovely gentleman !
no one’s listening to you .
greetings ,  caesar ,  my lord !
i hear some noise within.
he doesn’t need our mistrust; since he tells us our duties and the directions for what we have to do.
marcus luccicos, isn’t he in town?
this wretch has part confessed his villainy.
o ,  overcome them with zeal .
he’s a good man .
ah me!
i could really wish manners would invent some other kind of entertainment .
you have wonderful armor ,  but give my horse his due .
here ,  fluellen ,  stick this in your cap .
and ,  if you babble about mountains ,  let them throw millions of acres on us ,  until our ground ,  singeing his head against the burning sun ,  make the highest mountain like a wart !
it’s been longer ,  it’s been longer .
that’ll happen soon enough .
tom will chase them off . —go away ,  you mongrels !
are you going to take care of this thing now ?
lysander ,  if you live ,  good sir ,  wake up !
therefore, he that cannot lick his fingers won’t come back with me.
don’t you know me ,  father ?
katherina ,  you may stay .
come, let's go; all the strangers are gone.
i beg your pardon for loving you too much .
i’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before i’ll see the crown so misplaced .
here in the tent .
since she would love both of you ,  you two would be joined in that love .
i’ll ask later; first let’s go in to dinner .
then ,  hold my sword and turn your face away while i run on it .
destiny, tell us what comes next.
you were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything .
sweet montague ,  be true .
carriage ”  makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon .
and it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time .
ay, or else someone must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to imitate or to present the person of moonshine.
amen to that .
what then?
spread the rumor abroad that anne ,  my wife ,  is very sick .
shall we give up and drown ?
i don’t know what you mean by that ,  but i’m sure caesar fell down .
oh ,  how i love you !
gracious king, if it pleases you, we will bestow ourselves.
the duke’s in a meeting ?
it would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me .
are you a god ,  an angel ,  or a devil ,  that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?
tear him to pieces .
indeed ,  before he fell down ,  when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown ,  he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut .
if you’re so fond of her sin, give her permission to offend; because, if it doesn’t affect you, it affects nobody.
here ,  catch this chest; it is worth the trouble .
consider.
i be your mercy .
i’m happy to see you, my lady and my wife!
three words ,  dear romeo ,  and then it’s good night for real .
come, come, how you talk.
she has abandoned so many noble matches, her father, and her country, and her friends, to be called whore?
give me only one evil enemy at a time, and i'll fight their legions again and again.
we're going to church tomorrow .
